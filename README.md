## CabinetDatabase

This was a project for Mobile Applications Class. The purpose of the class was to develop a simple app using fragments, sensors, and external features.
The Cabinet Database displays cabinet models for the Kewaunee Scientific Corporations. You can view a list of models, search based on a number of criteria, or calculate your shipping distance from the Kewaunee factory to your current location (using Google Places).
Built in Android Studio and tested with Robotium.
